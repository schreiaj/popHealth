Measure Views
-------------

We're currently reworking the UI to address issues in the current codebase. The new UI is being developed within `new_dash.html.erb`, and references partials with `_TEMP` in the name (`_filters_TEMP.html.erb`, `measure_TEMP.html.erb`). At such a point that we are only supporting one UI, these TEMP files will be removed.
